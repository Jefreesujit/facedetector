# facedetector

An Experiment on Google Chrome's face detector API https://facedetect.netlify.com

Just try some images with faces or try your own face in the live camera, the app would identify the faces and draws boxes over it!

To put it available you must first enable Experimental Web Platform Features on your Chromeâ€™s flags. Very simple to do.

Go to :

[chrome://flags/#enable-experimental-web-platform-features](chrome://flags/#enable-experimental-web-platform-features)

And enable the **Experimental Web Platform features section**.

After enabling it, click on **Relaunch Now** button and you should be able to access the FaceDetector API
